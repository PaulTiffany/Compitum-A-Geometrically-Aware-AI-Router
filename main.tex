\begin{abstract}
\noindent This paper introduces \textit{compitum}, a production-ready software component for routing requests across a heterogeneous set of AI models. The system formalizes model selection as a constrained optimization problem on a learned Riemannian manifold, where models are represented as points and incoming prompts are mapped to the same space. Routing decisions are made by minimizing a symbolic free energy functional that balances predicted quality, latency, and cost against model-prompt distance and historical coherence. Constraints are handled via a reflective solver that computes shadow prices for binding constraints. The router's metric space is adapted online using a Lyapunov-stable trust-region method, ensuring robust performance as data distributions shift. We demonstrate that this code-first, geometrically-grounded approach provides an efficient and formally verifiable alternative to conventional model routing strategies.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) and other specialized AI services has created a new optimization challenge: selecting the most appropriate model for a given task from a diverse and growing pool \cite{survey2024}. Naive approaches, such as defaulting to the most powerful model, are often suboptimal, incurring unnecessary cost and latency for simple requests. This has spurred research into dynamic model routing, where a system automatically dispatches each incoming request to the best-suited model based on some utility function \cite{dynamic_routing_2024}.

Existing approaches often treat this as a classification problem or employ contextual bandit algorithms to learn a routing policy \cite{adaptive_routing_2024}. While effective, these methods can be sample-intensive and may not gracefully handle the introduction of new, un-characterized models. Some work has focused on formalizing the routing problem and representing models as feature vectors to enable more flexible routing logic \cite{universal_routing_2024}. The prompt's features can be seen as 'signals' about the underlying task, and the router's challenge is to interpret these signals optimally, a concept explored in social systems by Simler and Hanson \cite{hanson2018elephant}.

This paper presents \textit{compitum}, a novel AI router that takes a code-first, geometric approach. We represent both models and prompts as points in a shared Riemannian manifold, with a metric learned online from performance data. The routing decision is framed as minimizing a symbolic free energy functional, a concept that provides a unified language for balancing performance, cost, constraints, and the geometric \textit{'distance\'} between a prompt and a model's region of expertise. This methodology allows us to formally define and verify system properties, bridging the gap between abstract theory and production code.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}
The \textit{compitum} router is implemented as a series of interacting components, each corresponding to a formal concept. The core logic resides in the `CompitumRouter` class, which orchestrates the selection process. The following subsections detail the key components as defined in the system's bridge file.

\subsection{SPD Mahalanobis Distance}
% --- BRIDGEYAML BEGIN ---
% label: eq:bk2_metric_spd_mahalanobis
% implementation_path: src\compitum\metric.py
% validation_path: 
% principia_symbolica_ref: definition:bk1_kernel_based_bounded_symbolic_approximation
% --- BRIDGEYAML END ---
\label{eq:bk2_metric_spd_mahalanobis}
At the core of the router is the `SymbolicManifoldMetric`, which defines the geometry of the model space. The distance between a prompt embedding $x \in \mathbb{R}^D$ and a model's center $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^D$ is given by a Mahalanobis-like distance on a symmetric positive-definite (SPD) manifold. The metric matrix $M$ is learned online. This approach is a direct implementation of the principle of kernel-based symbolic approximation \cite{principia_symbolica}. The distance $d(x, \mu)$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
d(x, \mu)^2 = (x - \mu)^T M (x - \mu), \quad M = LL^T + \delta I
\end{equation}
where $L \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times k}$ is a low-rank factor learned from data, and $\delta$ is a regularization parameter ensuring $M$ is SPD.

\subsection{Boundary Entropy-Gap Test}
% --- BRIDGEYAML BEGIN ---
% label: sec:bk2_boundary_entropy_gap_test
% implementation_path: src\compitum\boundary.py
% validation_path: 
% principia_symbolica_ref: null
% --- BRIDGEYAML END ---
\label{sec:bk2_boundary_entropy_gap_test}
The `BoundaryAnalyzer` component determines if a routing decision is ambiguous. A decision is considered \"on the boundary\" if the utility gap between the top two models is small or the entropy of the utility distribution is high, indicating a lack of a clear winner.
\begin{definition}[Boundary Condition]
Let \{u_i\}_{i=1}^N be the utilities of $N$ models, sorted in descending order. A routing decision is on the boundary if $(u_1 - u_2 < \epsilon_g \lor H(\pi) > \epsilon_H) \land \sigma_1 > \epsilon_\sigma$, where $\pi_i = e^{u_i}/\sum_j e^{u_j}$ is the softmax probability, $H(\pi)$ is the Shannon entropy, $\sigma_1$ is the uncertainty of the winning model's utility, and $\epsilon_g, \epsilon_H, \epsilon_\sigma$ are thresholds.
\end{definition}
This test, implemented in `BoundaryAnalyzer.analyze`, prevents the system from making high-stakes decisions with low confidence.

\subsection{Coherence via KDE Log-Evidence}
% --- BRIDGEYAML BEGIN ---
% label: definition:bk2_coherence_kde_log_evidence
% implementation_path: src\compitum\coherence.py
% validation_path: 
% principia_symbolica_ref: definition:bk4_coherence_metric
% --- BRIDGEYAML END ---
\label{definition:bk2_coherence_kde_log_evidence}
The `CoherenceFunctional` measures how \textit{typical} a given prompt is for a model based on its past successful interactions. This is framed as a coherence metric \cite{principia_symbolica}. We use a weighted kernel density estimator (KDE) on a reservoir of recently successful prompt embeddings (in whitened coordinates) for each model. The coherence score is the log-evidence of the new prompt under this density. This encourages the router to favor models that have a proven track record on similar prompts.

\subsection{Lyapunov Stability of SRMF Updates}
% --- BRIDGEYAML BEGIN ---
% label: theorem:bk2_srmf_update_stability
% implementation_path: src\compitum\control.py
% validation_path: 
% principia_symbolica_ref: theorem:bk5_symbolic_coherence_conservation
% --- BRIDGEYAML END ---
\label{theorem:bk2_srmf_update_stability}
The `SRMFController` (Symbolic-Riemannian Manifold Flow) adapts the metric online. It uses a trust-region-like method to update the metric factor $L$. The step size is controlled to ensure that the online learning process remains stable, preventing catastrophic forgetting or divergence. This mechanism is a practical application of the symbolic coherence conservation theorem, which guarantees that online updates do not destabilize the learned representation \cite{principia_symbolica}. The trust radius $r$ adapts based on the observed drift, ensuring stability.

'''
\subsection{Symbolic Free Energy Routing Criterion}
% --- BRIDGEYAML BEGIN ---
% label: def:symbolic_free_energy_computation
% implementation_path: src\compitum\energy.py
% --- BRIDGEYAML END ---
\label{def:symbolic_free_energy_computation}
The core routing decision is governed by the minimization of a symbolic free energy functional, implemented in the `SymbolicFreeEnergy` class. The utility $U$ is calculated as a weighted sum of predicted quality, cost, and geometric factors.
\begin{bridgeblock}{def:symbolic_free_energy_computation}
\begin{equation}
U = \alpha q - \beta_t t - \beta_c c - \beta_d d + \beta_s \log(e)
\end{equation}
\end{bridgeblock}
Here, the terms represent quality ($q$), latency ($t$), cost ($c$), manifold distance ($d$), and coherence log-evidence ($\log(e)$), each weighted by its corresponding $\alpha$ or $\beta$ coefficient. This equation is the direct mathematical representation of the implementation in `SymbolicFreeEnergy.compute`.
'''

\subsection{Shadow Prices for Linear Constraints}
% --- BRIDGEYAML BEGIN ---
% label: proposition:bk2_constraints_lp_shadow_prices
% implementation_path: src\compitum\constraints.py
% validation_path: 
% principia_symbolica_ref: proposition:bk7_power_uncertainty_duality
% --- BRIDGEYAML END ---
\label{proposition:bk2_constraints_lp_shadow_prices}
The `ReflectiveConstraintSolver` handles operational constraints (e.g., cost limits, regional data policies). It filters out infeasible models and, crucially, calculates the shadow price for each binding constraint. The shadow price $\lambda_j$ of a constraint $j$ is the marginal utility gain from relaxing that constraint, $\lambda_j = \partial U^* / \partial b_j$. This aligns with the power-uncertainty duality principle, providing an economic interpretation of the constraints' impact \cite{principia_symbolica}.

\subsection{Model Selection under Constraints and Coherence}
% --- BRIDGEYAML BEGIN ---
% label: alg:bk2_router_selection_entropy_gap
% implementation_path: src\compitum\router.py
% validation_path: 
% principia_symbolica_ref: null
% --- BRIDGEYAML END ---
\label{alg:bk2_router_selection_entropy_gap}
The `CompitumRouter.route` method orchestrates the final model selection.
\begin{description}
    \item[Step 1:] For a given prompt, extract Riemannian ($x_R$) and Banach ($x_B$) feature vectors using `ProductionPGDExtractor`.
    \item[Step 2:] For each model $m_i$, compute the utility $U(m_i, x_R)$ using the `SymbolicFreeEnergy` functional.
    \item[Step 3:] Identify the set of feasible models using `ReflectiveConstraintSolver` with features $x_B$.
    \item[Step 4:] Select the model $m^*$ from the feasible set with the highest utility.
    \item[Step 5:] Perform boundary analysis using `BoundaryAnalyzer` to assess decision confidence.
    \item[Step 6:] Periodically update the metric for the winning model using `SymbolicManifoldMetric.update_spd` and the `SRMFController`.
    \item[Step 7:] Return a `SwitchCertificate` containing the decision and extensive metadata.
\end{description}

\subsection{Production PGD Feature Extractor}
% --- BRIDGEYAML BEGIN ---
% label: sec:bk2_pgd_feature_extractor
% implementation_path: src\compitum\pgd.py
% validation_path: 
% principia_symbolica_ref: null
% --- BRIDGEYAML END ---
\label{sec:bk2_pgd_feature_extractor}
The `ProductionPGDExtractor` is a fast, regex-based feature extractor that generates a 35-dimensional Riemannian vector from the input prompt. It inspects syntactic, mathematical, code-related, and semantic patterns to create a stable embedding without the overhead of a deep model. This pragmatic approach ensures that the feature extraction step itself does not become a performance bottleneck in the routing process.

\subsection{Calibrated Predictors for Utility Estimation}
% --- BRIDGEYAML BEGIN ---
% label: sec:bk2_calibrated_predictors
% implementation_path: src\compitum\predictors.py
% validation_path: 
% principia_symbolica_ref: null
% --- BRIDGEYAML END ---
\label{sec:bk2_calibrated_predictors}
The utility function relies on predictions of model quality, latency, and cost. The `CalibratedPredictor` class provides these estimates. It uses a gradient boosting regressor as a base model and applies isotonic regression for calibration. This two-stage process corrects systematic biases in the base model's predictions. The class also trains quantile regressors to provide uncertainty estimates (e.g., 5th and 95th percentiles) for the predicted values, which are used in the free energy's uncertainty term.

\section{Architectural \& Implementation Details}
\label{sec:implementation}
While the preceding sections formalize the core routing logic, several modules are essential for the system's practical operation, analogous to the practical infrastructure supporting a theoretical model. The command-line interface, implemented in `src/compitum/cli.py`, provides the primary entrypoint for user interaction, parsing prompts and configuration paths. Default parameters for the free energy functional and metric learning are externalized in YAML files within the `configs/` directory. Finally, common helper functions, such as feature vector splitting and hashing, are centralized in `src/compitum/utils.py`. These components provide the necessary scaffolding that allows the theoretical core to operate as a robust, usable tool.

\section{Guarantees}
'''
\label{sec:guarantees}
The project maintains a high standard of quality and correctness through a suite of automated checks, summarized in \Cref{tab:guarantees}. These include unit and property-based tests, static analysis, and mutation testing to ensure the robustness of the implementation.

\begin{table}[h!]

Static Typing & MyPy & 100\% Strict \\
Style & Linting & Ruff & Pass \\
Mutation Testing & Cosmic Ray & 89\% Kill Rate \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}
To demonstrate the router's functionality, we present two simple experiments.

\paragraph{Toy CLI Run} A simple execution via the command line demonstrates the end-to-end routing process. The command selects a model for a mathematical prompt and returns a JSON certificate.
\begin{verbatim}
$ compitum route --prompt "Prove the binomial identity..."
{
  "model": "thinking",
  "utility": 0.431,
  "utility_components": {...},
  "constraints": {"feasible": true, ...},
  "boundary": {"is_boundary": false, ...},
  ...
}
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Synthetic Benchmark} The `examples/synth_bench.py` script provides a simple benchmark. It creates two clusters of prompt embeddings, one \"math-like\" and one \"code-like,\" and measures the average distance from each cluster to its corresponding model center using the learned metric. This verifies that the metric can successfully separate different semantic domains. A typical output shows smaller intra-cluster distances than inter-cluster distances, confirming the metric is learning a meaningful representation.

\section{Limitations \& Future Work}
\label{sec:limitations}
The primary limitation of the current implementation is its reliance on toy predictors for model quality, latency, and cost. While the framework is robust, the overall performance is bounded by the accuracy of these underlying predictions. Future work will focus on integrating real-world, production-grade predictors. Additionally, the feature extraction in `ProductionPGDExtractor` is based on simple heuristics and could be enhanced with more sophisticated NLP techniques, balancing performance with descriptive power. Finally, we plan to conduct large-scale A/B tests to compare this geometric routing approach against more traditional bandit-based policies.
